# Machine Learning for Asset Managers Toolbox 
---

## Introduction

I started this work with the personal goal to master and test the concepts described in the book [Machine Learning for Asset Managers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/machine-learning-for-asset-managers/6D9211305EA2E425D33A9F38D0AE3545).

This repository contains the implementation of these concepts and answers to the exercises.

## Available Utilities

### Entropy Calculation
- Calculate the marginal entropy 
- Calculate the join entropy
- Calculate the mutual information (normalized as well)
- Calculate the conditional entropy 
- Calculate the variation of information (normalized as well)
- The possibility to use the optimal number of bins when calling the previous functions with bins=None

### Notebooks 
- Chapter 2 on distances summary and exercises tentative solutions
